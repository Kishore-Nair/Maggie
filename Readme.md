## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kishore-Nair/Maggie.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd maggi-assistant
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Assistant

Before running Maggi, ensure that Ollama is running in the background, as the AI mode relies on it.
Download ollama from: <https://ollama.com/>

**Starting Ollama:**

1.  **Open a new terminal or command prompt.** This will allow Ollama to run independently of Maggi.

2.  **Run the Ollama service.** The command to start Ollama might vary slightly depending on your installation method. Common commands include:

    * If you installed Ollama using the official method:
        ```bash
        ollama serve
        ```
    * On some systems, it might start automatically in the background. You can check if it's running by trying to interact with it or by checking your system's process monitor.

3.  **Keep this terminal window running in the background while you use Maggi.**

**Running Maggi:**

1.  Make sure you have a microphone connected to your system.

2.  Open a **new** terminal or command prompt (separate from the one running Ollama).

3.  Run the assistant script:

    ```bash
    python maggi_assistant.py
    ```

4.  You will be prompted to choose your mode:

      * **Voice Mode:** Speak commands to Maggi.
      * **Type Mode:** Type commands to interact with Maggi.

**Important:** Make sure Ollama is running *before* you try to use the "Invoke AI" command in Maggi. If Ollama is not running, the AI mode will not function correctly.

## Usage

### Voice Mode

Speak the command after Maggi says, "Listening...". For example:

* "Open YouTube"
* "Search for 'Artificial Intelligence' on Google"
* "Set a timer for 5 minutes"
* "What is the time?"

### Type Mode

Type your command when prompted:

* Type `open youtube`
* Type `search for Machine Learning`
* Type `check battery`
